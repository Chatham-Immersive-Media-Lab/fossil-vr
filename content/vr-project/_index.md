## Designing For The Classroom

Goals: 

### Facilitate Communication between professor and person in VR

- Directionally recognizable environment utilizing landmarks
- Almost No Audio
- Exploring Pass-through
- Verbally communicable interaction signifiers
- Verbally understandable fossil site names
- 3D model of controller instead of hand model

### Allow for Minimal Movement.

- Standing or Seated
- Can "bring the fossil to you" instead of walk over to it
- Hand-held close-ups that can be scaled and repositions

### Accessibility

- Everything works either standing/seated
- Colorblind-friendly UI elements
- Simple, effective interaction feedback

### Out of Scope
We were not able to implement everything we wished. With more resources, we would like to continue the project as a study in designing for asymmetric classroom experiences. We believe that asymetric classroom experiences, where not all the participants are in VR, and all are in the classroom together, is a fruitful avenue of research and future projects, and remains under-explored currently.

Other elements that were out of scope were accessibility features that required more technical investment to get running or working. An experience must be usable for as many humans as possible if the goal is to deploy it in the classroom, and we have more work to do in this regard.

- Listen to events fired off a macropad controlled by an arduino, allowing a professor to trigger events for students in VR.
- We wanted smoother support for adjusting the heights of the table for individuals seated. 
- Haptics feedback for interactions
- A flashlight. We think it would be interesting to allow the user to get close with a light to change the shadows on the fossil, exploring its shape in a novel way that is difficult to do without a realtime rendering engines.
- More fossil sites.
- We are not completely sold on our map interaction. Efforts at designing more tangible and flexible solutions add a cost of onboarding or prevent standing-only interaction.
